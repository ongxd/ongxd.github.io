    <h1>Our Background</h1>
    <p>TOLY was established in early 2018. The company s management team is composed by a number of experienced trainers from Taiwan. With their rich experience in management and their their valuable perspective in the industry, we are committed to develop the company and seek to be recognised globally.</p>
    <p>TOLY management team has greatly expanded internationally and on a quest to search for high quality ingredients around the world. Equipped with a deep knowledge and understanding of tea product, the company takes lead in new line of tea drink such as Brown Sugar Pearl Milk Tea which was well favoured by tea lovers.</p>
    <p>The roots of TOLY Bubble Tea sprouted in Kuala Lumpur where James, Anthony, & Davis were schoolmates. Unknowingly, their friendship would blossom into a partnership many years later, each sharing the same vision of a new healthy lifestyle and a vision to redefine the culture of tea-drinking.</p>
    <p>Turning their dreams into reality, the three of them set off on a journey where their wings of discovery spread across China, Taiwan and Japanese, researching and sampling all varieties of tea. Their quest to source the best tea leaves amounted to sampling 20 cups of tea a day. Sifting through the qualities of each type of tea leaf, they tested the suitability of each tea variety by trial and error. At the same time, they sampled a multitude of fruit varieties.</p>
